### Create your project

See the [Project Creation](project#creation) guide to create a new project.

## Get your API key

After creating a project, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. The tab "API Keys" will be selected by default. Now you can generate a new API key by clicking on the "Generate API Key" button. After generating the API key, you can copy it and use it in your app to integrate with ForceUpdate.

> [!NOTE]
> This API key is used to authenticate your app with ForceUpdate on frontend. From this API key the forceupdate will know which project is making the request.
