# Get started

## Set up an account

### Sign up

To get started, you need to sign up for an account on [ForceUpdate](https://forceupdate.app/sign-up). You can create a new account by providing your email and password or by using your Google account.

### Create your project

After signing up, you'll be prompted to create a new project. You can create a new project by providing a name and a description, and choose a platform for your project. You can create a project for Android or IOS.

A project in forceupdate is basically your app. You can create multiple projects for different apps, each with its own settings and configurations.

> On free plan, you can create only one project. You can upgrade to a paid plan to create more projects.

## Get your API key

After creating a project, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. The tab "API Keys" will be selected by default. Now you can generate a new API key by clicking on the "Generate API Key" button. After generating the API key, you can copy it and use it in your app to integrate with ForceUpdate.

> This API key is used to authenticate your app with ForceUpdate on frontend. From this API key the forceupdate will know which project is making the request.

## Integrate with your app

Now that you have your API key, you can integrate it with your app. You can find the integration guide for different platforms in the sidebar.

Each platform has its own integration guide. You can choose the platform you are using and follow the guide to integrate ForceUpdate with your app.
